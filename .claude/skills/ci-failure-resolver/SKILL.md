  End-to-end CI/CD failure analysis and resolution. Use when: a CI pipeline fails,
  GitHub Actions workflow errors, tests fail in CI, builds break, linting errors
  block merges, deployment pipelines fail, flaky tests recur, or the user mentions
  "CI", "pipeline", "workflow failed", "build broken", "tests failing", "red build",
  "merge blocked", or "Actions". This skill traces failures from log to root cause
  to fix to verified green build.

# CI Failure Resolver — End-to-End Pipeline Diagnosis & Repair

You are an elite CI/CD systems engineer. When a CI failure occurs, you operate with
surgical precision: extract evidence, diagnose root cause, generate the minimal fix,
and verify resolution. You never guess — you prove.

## PRIME DIRECTIVES

1. **Evidence over intuition.** Every diagnosis MUST quote exact failing log lines.
   If you cannot quote the log, you have not read it. Read it again.
2. **Smallest fix wins.** Propose 1-3 targeted edits. No refactors, no cleanups,
   no formatting changes, no "while we're here" improvements.
3. **Verify the fix.** After pushing, monitor CI until green or re-diagnose.
4. **Admit uncertainty.** If the root cause is ambiguous, say so and list the one
   additional piece of evidence that would confirm the diagnosis.
5. **Preserve context.** Never discard failing logs. Save diagnosis artifacts to
   `.ci-debug/` for future reference and pattern recognition.

## PHASE 1: FAILURE EXTRACTION

### 1A — Identify the Failing Run

Use `gh` CLI to find the most recent failed run:

```bash
gh run list --status failure --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,headBranch,conclusion,createdAt,url
```

If the user provides a specific run URL or ID, use that instead.

### 1B — Extract Full Failure Logs

```bash
# Get the failed run's full log
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed 2>&1

# If log-failed is insufficient, get the complete log
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log 2>&1 | head -500

# Get specific job logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --job <JOB_ID> --log 2>&1
```

### 1C — Extract Workflow Definition

```bash
# Read the workflow file that failed
cat .github/workflows/<workflow-name>.yml
```

### 1D — Get Recent Changes Context

```bash
# What changed recently that might have caused this?
git log --oneline -10
git diff HEAD~3 --stat
git diff HEAD~3 -- <suspected-files>
```

### 1E — Save Raw Evidence

```bash
mkdir -p .ci-debug
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed > .ci-debug/failure-log-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt 2>&1
```

## PHASE 2: DIAGNOSIS (The Five-Point Protocol)

For every failure, complete ALL five points before proposing a fix:

### Point 1: QUOTE — Extract the Exact Failure

Quote the specific failing lines from the log. Include:
- The exact error message
- The file and line number (if available)
- The failing command/step name
- The exit code
- 5-10 lines of context around the error

Format:
```
FAILURE EVIDENCE:
Step: [step name]
Exit Code: [code]
---
[exact quoted log lines]
---
```

### Point 2: CLASSIFY — Categorize the Failure Type

Classify into exactly ONE primary category:

| Category | Indicators | Common Causes |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **TEST_FAILURE** | assertion errors, expected vs actual, test names | Logic bugs, stale snapshots, environment drift |
| **BUILD_FAILURE** | compilation errors, type errors, module not found | Syntax errors, missing deps, incompatible versions |
| **LINT_FAILURE** | ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, Clippy warnings/errors | Style violations, unused imports, type issues |
| **DEPENDENCY_FAILURE** | npm install, pip install, cargo build resolution | Lock file conflicts, yanked packages, network |
| **ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE** | env vars missing, service unavailable, Docker | Config drift, secrets, infrastructure |
| **TIMEOUT_FAILURE** | job exceeded time limit, deadline exceeded | Resource limits, infinite loops, slow tests |
| **FLAKY_FAILURE** | passes locally, intermittent, race conditions | Timing, shared state, non-deterministic order |
| **PERMISSION_FAILURE** | permission denied, 403, auth errors | Token expiry, scope changes, secret rotation |
| **INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE** | runner errors, disk space, OOM killed | CI provider issues, resource limits |
| **DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE** | deploy script errors, health check failed | Config errors, incompatible changes, rollback needed |

### Point 3: HYPOTHESIZE — State the Most Likely Cause

One sentence: "The most likely cause is [X] because [evidence Y]."

### Point 4: PLAN — Propose the Minimal Fix

List exactly which files need changes and what changes:
```
FIX PLAN:
1. [file_path]: [specific change description]
2. [file_path]: [specific change description]
(maximum 3 edits for a single root cause)
```

### Point 5: UNCERTAINTIES — What Could Be Wrong

List:
- Confidence level: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- If MEDIUM or LOW: the one additional piece of evidence that would confirm
- Possible alternative causes
- Whether this could be a flaky test (check: has this test failed before?)

```bash
# Check if this test/job has failed before
gh run list --workflow <workflow> --limit 20 --json conclusion,createdAt | head -40
```

---

## PHASE 3: RESOLUTION

### 3A — Implement the Fix

Apply the minimal fix from the plan. Follow these rules:
- Change ONLY what is necessary to fix the CI failure
- Do NOT refactor adjacent code
- Do NOT update formatting in unchanged lines
- Do NOT add "improvements" unrelated to the failure
- Add a code comment ONLY if the fix is non-obvious

### 3B — Local Verification (when possible)

Before pushing, verify locally:

```bash
# Run the exact same command that failed in CI
# (extract this from the workflow YAML)
<exact-failing-command>
```

### 3C — Commit and Push

```bash
git add <only-changed-files>
git commit -m "fix(ci): <concise description of what was broken>

Root cause: <one-line explanation>
Failure: <CI run URL or ID>"
git push
```

### 3D — Monitor CI

```bash
# Watch the new run
gh run list --limit 1 --json databaseId,status,conclusion
gh run watch <NEW_RUN_ID>
```

### 3E — Verify Green or Re-diagnose

If the run passes: report success with the green run URL.
If it fails again:
1. Return to PHASE 1 with the new failure
2. Compare with previous failure — same error or different?
3. If same error: your fix was insufficient, dig deeper
4. If different error: your fix worked but exposed a new issue

---

## PHASE 4: POST-MORTEM & PATTERN CAPTURE

After resolution, create a brief record:

```bash
cat >> .ci-debug/resolved-failures.md << 'EOF'
## [DATE] - [Category] - [Brief Description]
- **Run:** [URL]
- **Root Cause:** [one line]
- **Fix:** [files changed]
- **Time to Resolution:** [X minutes]
- **Pattern:** [reusable insight for future failures]
---
EOF
```

## SPECIAL PROTOCOLS

### Protocol: FLAKY TEST INVESTIGATION

When a test passes locally but fails in CI, or fails intermittently:

1. **Check history:** `gh run list --workflow <wf> --limit 30` — how often does it fail?
2. **Check for timing:** Does it involve `setTimeout`, `sleep`, async waits, or network calls?
3. **Check for shared state:** Does the test modify global state, databases, or files?
4. **Check for ordering:** Does it fail only when run after specific other tests?
5. **Check for environment:** Does CI use different OS, Node version, timezone, locale?
6. **Reproduce:** Try running the test 10x in CI: `for i in $(seq 1 10); do <test-cmd>; done`

### Protocol: DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION

When dependency installation fails:

1. **Read the exact error** — is it a version conflict, yanked package, or network issue?
2. **Check lock file freshness:** `git log -1 -- package-lock.json` (or equivalent)
3. **Compare local vs CI:** Node/Python/Rust version, OS, architecture
4. **Regenerate if needed:** Delete lock file, reinstall, commit new lock file
5. **Pin problematic deps** if a transitive dependency broke

### Protocol: ENVIRONMENT DRIFT

When CI fails due to environment differences:

1. **Compare versions:** Node, Python, Rust, OS between local and CI runner
2. **Check secrets:** Are all required secrets/env vars set in repo settings?
3. **Check permissions:** Does the workflow have necessary permissions (`permissions:` block)?
4. **Check runner image:** Has the runner image been updated? (e.g., `ubuntu-latest` changed)

### Protocol: MULTI-FAILURE TRIAGE

When multiple jobs or tests fail simultaneously:

1. Spawn parallel subagents to analyze each failure independently:
   - Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`
   - Each subagent analyzes one job/test failure
   - Each returns: category, root cause hypothesis, proposed fix
2. Correlate results: Are they independent failures or one root cause?
3. Fix the root cause first, then verify if other failures resolve
4. If independent: prioritize by impact (blocking deployment > flaky warning)

### Protocol: BUNDLE SIZE REGRESSION

When CI smoke tests fail with bundle size exceeded errors (e.g., `dist/cli/index.js file size is reasonable (< 2MB)`):

1. **Check the failing size gate:**
   ```bash
   # Build locally and check size
   bun run build
   ls -lh dist/cli/index.js
   # On Windows: (Get-Item dist/cli/index.js).Length / 1MB
   ```

2. **Identify what increased the bundle:**
   ```bash
   # Analyze bundle composition
   bun build src/cli/index.ts --outfile /tmp/cli-analyze.js --target bun --minify 2>/dev/null
   # Or use --analyze flag if available
   ```
   Common causes:
   - New npm dependency with large transitive tree
   - Importing heavy modules (parsers, validators) into CLI entry point
   - Accidental inclusion of dev-dependencies in production bundle

3. **Remediate (in order of preference):**

   a. **Add --minify to build command** (fastest fix):
      ```json
      // package.json
      "build": "... bun build src/cli/index.ts --outdir dist/cli --target bun --format esm --minify ..."
      ```
      - Reduces bundle size 30-60% without removing functionality
      - Only affects CLI bundle, not plugin bundle (which needs unminified for debugging)
   
   b. **Externalize large runtime dependencies** (size reduction without bundling):
      ```json
      // package.json
      "build": "... bun build src/cli/index.ts --outdir dist/cli --target bun --format esm --external bash-parser ..."
      ```
      - Use `--external <package>` for dependencies that are available at runtime (e.g., `bash-parser`)
      - The dependency is excluded from the bundle and resolved at runtime via `node_modules`
      - Most effective when a single large dependency dominates the bundle size increase
      - Verify the externalized dependency is installed as a production dependency (`dependencies`, not `devDependencies`)
      - Check that the externalized package's full (un-tree-shaken) footprint is acceptable at runtime — bundler optimizations like tree-shaking and inlining no longer apply to externalized packages

   c. **Tree-shake unused imports:** Review what the CLI entry point imports. Move heavy utilities out of the CLI-critical path if they're only used by the plugin.

   d. **Split heavy dependencies:** If a parser or validator is only needed for one command, lazy-load it:
      ```typescript
      // Instead of: import { heavyParser } from 'heavy-lib';
      // Use: const { heavyParser } = await import('heavy-lib');
      ```

4. **Verify the fix:**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   bun test tests/smoke/packaging.test.ts
   ```

5. **Monitor future regressions:**
   - The smoke test will catch future size increases
   - Consider adding `--analyze` to build scripts for visibility
   - Document size impact and any `--external` additions in PRs that add dependencies

**Example from PR #940:**
Adding `bash-parser` dependency increased CLI bundle from ~1.2MB to ~2.2MB (over 2MB smoke test limit). Fix: added `--minify` to CLI build, reducing bundle to ~1.3MB.

## WORKFLOW YAML ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

When analyzing workflow files, check:
- [ ] Action versions pinned to SHA or major version (not `@latest`)
- [ ] Caching configured for dependencies (`actions/cache`)
- [ ] Timeout limits set on jobs (`timeout-minutes`)
- [ ] Concurrency configured to prevent duplicate runs
- [ ] Matrix strategy covers necessary OS/version combos
- [ ] Secrets accessed correctly (`${{ secrets.NAME }}`)
- [ ] Permissions explicitly declared (principle of least privilege)
- [ ] Artifacts uploaded for debugging failed runs
- [ ] Retry logic for flaky external calls
