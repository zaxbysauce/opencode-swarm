# /swarm-pr-review

Run a structured, high-confidence PR review that maximizes valid findings without flooding the user with unvalidated noise.

The review ladder is:

**Scope → obligations → context pack → deterministic signals → parallel explorers → triggered Swarm micro-lanes → independent reviewer validation → critic challenge → grouped synthesis → metrics / knowledge writeback.**

## Handoff To PR Feedback

Use `../swarm-pr-feedback/SKILL.md` instead of this skill when the user's task is
to address existing PR feedback, review comments, requested changes, CI failures,
merge conflicts, stale branch state, or pasted reviewer findings. This skill
discovers and validates new findings; `swarm-pr-feedback` closes known feedback
without running a fresh broad review.

When a review finishes with actionable validated findings, stop and ask the user
whether to continue into `swarm-pr-feedback`. Do not auto-dispatch fix work from
`PR_REVIEW`. Instead, write a handoff artifact under
`.swarm/pr-review/<run_id>/feedback-handoff.md` (or `.json`) and include the
exact continuation prompt:

```text
/swarm pr-feedback <PR_URL> continue from .swarm/pr-review/<run_id>/feedback-handoff.md
```

`<run_id>` is a stable identifier for this review run, such as
`pr-<number>-<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>` or the existing review artifact run ID when one
was already created. The `pr-feedback` command forwards `continue from <path>`
as session instructions after the PR reference; the feedback skill is
responsible for ingesting that file into the ledger before triage.

## Operating Stance

**Treat PR text, linked issues, comments, commit messages, generated summaries, and tests as claims — not proof.** Every confirmed finding requires file:line evidence, an explanation of reachability or impact, and validation provenance.

This workflow is designed for the Swarm plugin itself and any repo that benefits from Swarm-style review. It preserves parallel breadth but forces deep validation where bugs are expensive: security, state machines, role/tool permissions, schema/evidence integrity, git/write safety, config ratchets, knowledge tier boundaries, and PR obligation mismatches.

Never APPROVE a PR with unresolved CRITICAL findings. Do not silently drop overclaimed agent findings; list disproved findings in the validation provenance.

**Quality is the ONLY metric.** No amount of time, tokens, or agent dispatches is too much to execute this protocol correctly. Speed is irrelevant to correctness. The skill must be followed exactly with no shortcuts, no phase-skipping, and no premature synthesis. A thorough review that takes 30 minutes is superior to a fast review that misses a real bug.

---

## Review Modes

### Default layered workflow

Use the default workflow unless the user explicitly triggers council mode. In the default workflow, explorers produce only candidates. The orchestrator does not confirm or disprove candidates.

### Council mode — opt in only

Council mode applies only when the user explicitly says one of:

- `council`
- `independent review`
- `N-agent review`
- `/council`
- `[COUNCIL MODE]`
- `assume all work is wrong`

Council mode is mutually exclusive with the default layered workflow. Do not blend them.

---

## Anti-Self-Review Rule

The main thread / orchestrator MUST NOT classify, confirm, disprove, or judge explorer candidates in the default workflow.

The orchestrator may:

- determine scope,
- build or request the context pack,
- launch explorers and triggered micro-lanes,
- extract candidates from lane artifacts via `parse_lane_candidates` or equivalent parser,
- filter, group, and chunk candidates for reviewer dispatch,
- route candidates to reviewers,
- route reviewer-confirmed findings to critics,
- group validated findings,
- prepare the final report.

The orchestrator MUST NOT:

- re-read a candidate's target code to decide if it is valid,
- silently downgrade or discard an explorer candidate,
- treat tool output as a confirmed finding,
- report a finding that no reviewer validated,
- classify or judge candidates based on preview text alone — always use the structured parser output.

If the orchestrator catches itself validating code, it must stop and delegate validation to a reviewer subagent.

Exception: in explicit Council mode only, the main thread may act as the independent reviewer as described in the Council Mode section. Prefer a reviewer subagent when available.

---

## Scope Detection

Determine review scope using this priority:

1. explicit user-provided PR URL, PR number, commit, branch, or file scope,
2. current feature branch diff vs `origin/main`, `main`, `origin/master`, or `master`,
3. staged changes,
4. latest commit,
5. user-specified files or directories.

Record:

- base ref,
- head ref,
- commit range,
- changed files,
- deleted files,
- generated files,
- lockfiles,
- test files,
- docs/config/schema files,
- whether the working tree is dirty.

If scope cannot be determined, review the narrowest safe scope available and state the limitation.

### Pre-flight git ref availability

Before launching explorers (Phase 3), confirm the PR branch refs are available:
- If `head_ref` is a remote branch that is not checked out locally, fetch it via `git fetch origin <head_ref>`
- **Check out the head branch locally.** Explorer agents read files from the working tree, not from git history — passing the commit range in the delegation prompt is not sufficient because `Read` / `Glob` / `Grep` tools operate on the filesystem. Without a checkout, explorers silently read the base branch's version of changed files and produce invalid candidates. **Before checking out, verify the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain`). If uncommitted changes exist, stash them or abort the checkout to prevent data loss.**
- Explicitly pass the commit range (`base_ref..head_ref`) in every explorer delegation so explorers have the revision context for `git show` commands if they need to inspect specific versions.

If refs cannot be fetched or checked out, state the limitation in the context pack.

## Phase 0A: Existing PR Signal Ingestion

When reviewing a PR, ingest and triage every existing signal BEFORE starting
Phase 0. These are candidate generators and obligation sources, not
pre-confirmed findings.

This intake includes:

- review comments, review summaries, requested changes, and bot findings,
- CI/check failures, annotations, and relevant logs,
- mergeability/conflicts, `mergeStateStatus`, and stale/base-drift state,
- PR body claims, linked issues, acceptance criteria, and test-plan claims,
- commit messages and app/bot commits on the PR branch.

When thread resolution state matters, prefer GraphQL review-thread inspection.
If GraphQL is unavailable, keep the signal and mark
`resolution_state: UNKNOWN`; do not drop it from scope.

### Step 1 — Fetch all PR feedback surfaces

```bash
# Issue comments (general PR thread)
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments

# Review comments (inline code comments)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments

# Review summaries (approve/request-changes/comment events)
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviews

# Bot/automated reviews (Copilot, Codex, CodeRabbit, etc.)
# Inline review comments — use REST API for reliable bot detection via user.type
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments --jq '.[] | select((.user.type // "") == "Bot" or (.user.login // "" | test("bot|copilot|coderabbit|codex"; "i")))'
```

For general PR comments (not inline), use the issue comments endpoint:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{PR_NUMBER}/comments --jq '.[] | select((.user.type // "") == "Bot" or (.user.login // "" | test("bot|copilot|coderabbit|codex"; "i")))'
```

### Step 2 — Classify each comment

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Human review with file:line evidence** | Add as candidate finding with `source: existing-review` — still needs reviewer validation |
| **Bot/automated finding with specific code reference** | Add as candidate finding with `source: bot-review` — high false-positive rate, treat as unverified |
| **General feedback / style preference** | Add as advisory obligation |
| **Resolved/outdated comment** | Skip — note in report under "Ingested Resolved Comments" |
| **Requested changes not yet addressed** | Add as HIGH-priority obligation |

### Step 3 — Merge into review pipeline

All ingested comments become candidate findings or obligations. They follow the
same Phase 3-8 pipeline as freshly discovered findings. Ingested findings are
NOT pre-confirmed — they still require independent reviewer validation per the
Anti-Self-Review Rule.

**Comment-ledger output:**
```
[INGESTED] | source | category | file:line (if applicable) | original_author | status: PENDING_VALIDATION / SKIPPED_OUTDATED / ADVISORY
```

### Anti-patterns
- ✗ Ignoring bot reviews because "bots produce false positives" — they also catch real issues
- ✗ Pre-confirming human review comments without independent validation — even senior reviewers make mistakes
- ✗ Skipping inline review comments and only reading the summary — inline comments contain the evidence

## Phase 0B: Mergeability and Branch-State Intake

Before investing effort in review lanes, verify the PR is mergeable and record
branch-state signals. `PR_REVIEW` remains read-only: do not resolve conflicts,
commit, push, rebase, merge, or reset from this mode. Instead, carry current
mergeability, stale-head, and branch-drift facts into the review ledger and the
feedback handoff artifact.

### Step 1 — Check merge state

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

The response has two independent fields. Handle each:

**`mergeable` field** — whether GitHub can compute mergeability:
| Value | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `MERGEABLE` | No conflicts detected | Proceed — check `mergeStateStatus` below |
| `CONFLICTING` | Merge conflicts exist | Record the blocker, keep the review read-only, and hand conflict resolution to `swarm-pr-feedback` |
| `UNKNOWN` | GitHub still computing | Wait 30s, re-check |

**`mergeStateStatus` field** — overall branch state:
| Value | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `CLEAN` | All checks pass, no conflicts — proceed to Phase 0 |
| `BEHIND` | Branch behind base — note in report; non-blocking if merge queue handles it |
| `DIRTY` | Merge conflicts exist — keep reviewing, but record the conflict as a first-class blocker in the ledger and handoff artifact |
| `BLOCKED` | External blocker (branch protection, failing required check) — investigate and record the blocker |

### Step 2 — Record conflicts and blockers (when CONFLICTING or DIRTY)

When the PR has merge conflicts:

1. **Determine the PR's base branch and verify the state:**
   ```bash
   BASE_REF=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName')
   git fetch origin $BASE_REF
   gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,baseRefName,headRefName
   ```

2. **Capture the affected scope without changing the branch:**
   - List the files or subsystems implicated by the conflict if GitHub exposes them,
     or note that the exact conflict set is still unknown.
   - Identify whether the conflict appears mechanical (lockfile / generated output /
     simple overlap) or semantic (logic changed on both sides). This is triage
     signal for the follow-on feedback run, not permission to resolve it here.

3. **Record explicit next action for the handoff artifact:**
   - `CONFLICT-### | mechanical | likely resolvable during pr-feedback`
   - `CONFLICT-### | semantic | requires focused fix + validation during pr-feedback`
   - `STALE-### | behind base by policy` when the branch is only stale, not conflicted

4. **Document in report:** List the branch-state facts, why they matter to the
   review, and what `swarm-pr-feedback` must verify before it edits code.

### Conflict resolution anti-patterns
- ✗ Accepting "ours" or "theirs" for all conflicts without reading them
- ✗ Resolving semantic conflicts without understanding both sides
- ✗ Pushing resolution without running tests on the merged result
- ✗ Treating `PR_REVIEW` as the place to fix branch state — this mode stays read-only

## Phase 0B-bis: Pre-Handoff Parallel Work Snapshot

When the review surfaces findings that will likely need `swarm-pr-feedback`,
re-check for **parallel work** since the last fetch. The PR author, the bot
reviewer, or another swarm may have pushed commits while you were reviewing.
This is still read-only: capture the remote state so the handoff artifact starts
from the right branch facts.

### Step 1 — Refetch and compare

```bash
git fetch origin <pr-branch>
git log HEAD..origin/<pr-branch> --oneline
```

### Step 2 — Evaluate new commits

For each new commit on the remote:

1. **Read the commit message and diff.** Use `git show <commit> --stat` to see
   file scope, then `git show <commit> -- <file>` to see the actual changes.
2. **Compare against the pending handoff scope:**
   - Does the remote commit touch the same files as the validated findings?
   - Does the remote commit appear to already address a finding you planned to
     hand off?
   - Does the remote commit introduce a new branch-state fact the handoff should
     mention?
3. **Default stance: prefer the remote state as the next baseline.** Run
   the [`parallel-work-check`](../generated/parallel-work-check/SKILL.md)
   protocol for the formal decision template and record the outcome in the
   handoff artifact.

### Step 3 — Three outcomes

- **Parallel work supersedes:** Mark the older local checkout as stale in the
  handoff artifact and tell `swarm-pr-feedback` to re-check out the current
  remote head before editing.
- **Parallel work complements:** Carry both the validated findings and the new
  remote commits into the handoff artifact so `swarm-pr-feedback` can verify the
  combined state before patching.
- **Parallel work unrelated:** Note that the remote moved, but keep the same
  validated finding set.

### Anti-patterns

- ✗ Pushing your fix without checking if the remote already fixed it — causes
  duplicate work and may even fail the push if the commits conflict
- ✗ Force-pushing over parallel work because "I started this first" — the
  parallel agent may have access to context you don't (different swarm
  configuration, different model, different time budget)
- ✗ Blindly taking remote work without verifying it's actually better — the
  parallel work may be incomplete or take a different approach that doesn't
  match the original finding's intent

### Example: parallel swarm superseded local fix work

```
PARALLEL WORK CHECK (pre-fix):
- Branch: copilot/fix-legacy-hive-data-migration
- Local HEAD: 3c04997c fix: resolve PR #1238 review findings
- Remote HEAD: 79d7ec64 fix(knowledge-migrator): harden legacy migration loop
- Diverged: yes (remote is 2 commits ahead with more comprehensive fix)
- New commits on remote: 2
- Parallel swarm work detected: yes (different author)
- Decision: abandon-use-remote
- Rationale: Remote added 17 unit tests + try/catch error handling that
  surpassed my planned batch-rewrite. Verified by re-running the test suite:
  remote has 25/25 passing, my local plan would have produced 9/9.
```

# Default Review Workflow

## Phase 0: Context Pack and Review Signal Collection

Before launching explorers, build a compact `swarm-pr-review-context` in scratch or as a local artifact if file writes are allowed.

The context pack must include, when available:

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "base_ref": "...",
    "head_ref": "...",
    "commit_range": "...",
    "changed_files": [],
    "changed_hunks": [],
    "public_api_changes": [],
    "deleted_or_renamed_files": [],
    "generated_files": []
  },
  "pr_metadata": {
    "title": "...",
    "body_claims": [],
    "checkboxes": [],
    "linked_issues": [],
    "review_comments": [],
    "commit_messages": []
  },
  "obligations": [],
  "repo_graph": {
    "source": ".swarm/repo-graph.json or fallback search",
    "changed_symbols": [],
    "callers": [],
    "callees": [],
    "imports": [],
    "exports": [],
    "sibling_implementations": []
  },
  "deterministic_signals": {
    "ci": [],
    "tests": [],
    "coverage_delta": [],
    "lint_typecheck_build": [],
    "security_scanners": [],
    "dependency_audit": [],
    "secrets_scan": [],
    "mutation_testing": []
  },
  "swarm_artifacts": {
    "evidence_bundles": [],
    "knowledge_hits": [],
    "phase_state": [],
    "metrics": []
  },
  "risk_triggers": []
}
```

### Context pack rules

- Diff-only review is allowed for quick orientation, but not enough to confirm nontrivial findings.
- For every changed production file, identify at least one caller, consumer, import path, route entrypoint, or reason none exists.
- If `.swarm/repo-graph.json` exists, use it to seed impact cones.
- If no repo graph exists, build a shallow impact cone using imports, exports, symbol search, route registration, CLI registration, or test references.
- Pull in relevant `.swarm/evidence/`, `.swarm/state`, `.swarm/knowledge`, or hive/project knowledge entries when present.
- Historical knowledge may guide candidate generation but cannot confirm a finding by itself.
- Mark stale, quarantined, or cross-project knowledge as advisory until independently verified in this repo.

---

## Phase 1: Intent Reconstruction / Obligation Extraction

Reconstruct what the PR is obligated to deliver before looking for bugs.

Use deterministic precedence, highest to lowest:

1. PR checkboxes and acceptance criteria,
2. linked issues / tickets,
3. explicit user request in the current conversation,
4. commit scopes and commit messages,
5. test names and test assertions,
6. interface diff / exported API changes,
7. changelog, README, migration, or docs edits,
8. LLM synthesis only when no higher-precedence source exists.

Output an obligation list:

```text
O-001 | source | claim | affected files/symbols | status: UNVERIFIED | evidence refs: []
```

For each obligation, record:

- source,
- exact claim,
- affected files or symbols,
- verification status: `UNVERIFIED → IN_PROGRESS → MET / PARTIALLY_MET / NOT_MET / UNVERIFIABLE`,
- linked finding ID when unmet,
- reason if unverifiable.

Tests are claims. A passing or added test does not prove the obligation unless the reviewer inspects the assertion strength and relevant code path.

### Quantitative claim verification

PR body numerical claims (test counts, coverage percentages, assertion counts, performance benchmarks) are obligations, not proof. For each quantitative claim:

1. Extract the claim and its source (PR body, comment, commit message).
2. Verify against actual tool output or CI artifacts when available.
3. If the claim cannot be independently verified, mark the obligation `UNVERIFIABLE` with reason.
4. If the claim is disproved by evidence, create a finding linking the discrepancy.

Common patterns to verify:
- "N tests pass" → count actual test results from CI logs or test runner output
- "N% coverage" → compare against coverage report
- "No regressions" → verify against test runner failure count

---

## Phase 2: Deterministic Signal Ingestion

Ingest deterministic signals as candidate generators. They are never final findings.

Use available local artifacts first. Run safe read-only or standard project validation commands only when appropriate for the environment.

Candidate signal sources include:

- CI failures and logs,
- test failures,
- coverage delta,
- lint/typecheck/build output,
- `git diff --check`,
- dependency audit output,
- lockfile diff,
- CodeQL alerts,
- Semgrep or SAST findings,
- secrets scan findings,
- license scan findings,
- mutation testing output,
- package manager warnings,
- generated schema diffs.

Record each signal as:

```text
[TOOL_CANDIDATE] | tool | severity | file:line | claim | raw_signal_summary | confidence
```

Tool candidate rules:

- Confirm reachability before reporting.
- Confirm PR-introducedness before reporting as a PR blocker.
- Confirm that a framework, schema, middleware, caller guard, or test isolation rule does not already mitigate it.
- Do not report scanner output verbatim without reviewer validation.
- Redact secrets; never paste raw credentials into the final output.

---

## Phase 3: Parallel Base Explorer Lanes

Launch all base lanes with `dispatch_lanes_async` when available. Pass the six lane specs together, set `max_concurrent` to `6`, record the returned `batch_id`, and continue only non-dependent architect work: refine the obligation ledger, inspect PR metadata, prepare micro-lane trigger checks, and run deterministic read-only local tools. Do not synthesize findings from running lanes. Keep each lane `prompt` compact: send the shared review context (PR diff, obligation ledger, scope) ONCE via the `common_prompt` field, or have lanes read it from a file by absolute path, instead of inlining the same large blob into all six prompts — oversized inline prompts produce malformed or truncated tool-call JSON and force clumsy file workarounds.

Before Phase 4 or synthesis, call `collect_lane_results` with `wait: true` for the base-lane batch and treat the collected `lane_results` as the join barrier. Missing, stale, cancelled, or failed base lanes are explicit review coverage gaps. If `dispatch_lanes_async` is unavailable, use blocking `dispatch_lanes`; if that is also unavailable, simulate isolated passes. Do not let one lane's conclusions bias another lane, and record unavailable deterministic dispatch in the validation gate.

### Candidate extraction via parser

After `collect_lane_results` returns for base lanes, process each lane result
that carries an `output_ref`. The orchestrator MUST use the candidate parser
rather than preview-text extraction:

1. For each `output_ref` (or batched), call `parse_lane_candidates` (or the
   internal `parseAndPersist` module function) with `output_ref` and `producer`
   flags; the parser auto-detects the format family per row. The parser reads
   the full artifact from disk (no preview truncation issue) and returns
   structured `ParseResultWithSidecar` records.
2. Filter the returned `candidates[]` array by `producer: "swarm-pr-review"` and
   the relevant `row_format_family` (e.g., `base_explorer` for base lanes,
   `micro_lane` for micro-lanes). Filtering happens on the parsed results, NOT
   on the tool input.
3. Group the filtered candidates into reviewer-sized chunks:
   - by file area (group by the directory or module of the `file_line` field),
   - by category (group by the `category` field),
   - by count (target max 50 candidates per chunk; smaller chunks are fine).
4. Dispatch reviewer lanes (one per chunk) with bounded in-context candidate
   lists. Each reviewer lane receives only the candidates from its assigned
   chunk.

If a lane has `output_degraded: true`, `transcript_incomplete: true`, or no usable `output_ref`, record an explicit
coverage gap and re-dispatch a narrower lane or mark affected candidates
UNVERIFIED. Never infer candidate absence from a preview.

**Fallback convention:** If the parser is unavailable, the explorer MAY emit
`[CANDIDATE]` rows in the lane output as a fallback convention (see the
Explorer Prompt Template at the end of this skill), but the orchestrator
SHOULD use the parser as the primary extraction mechanism.

**lane id uniqueness for parallel dispatches:** When re-dispatching failed or
re-running explorer lanes, every `dispatch_lanes_async` or `dispatch_lanes`
lane `id` MUST be unique within that dispatch batch and should include lane and
attempt suffixes (e.g., `pr_review_explore_lane1_attempt2`). Never reuse an id
in the same batch unless intentionally replacing that exact lane before dispatch.

Explorers optimize for recall. Over-reporting is expected. Explorers produce candidates only.

| Lane | Focus | Required checks |
|---|---|---|
| Lane 1: Correctness and edge cases | Logic errors, null/undefined handling, incorrect operators, async ordering, races, off-by-one, error paths | input domain, nullability, async/await, loop termination, exception behavior, backward compatibility |
| Lane 2: Security and trust boundaries | Injection, authz/authn bypass, SSRF, path traversal, secret exposure, unsafe deserialization, prompt injection | untrusted input sources, sanitization, credential handling, permission boundary, private network access, output escaping |
| Lane 3: Dependencies and deployment safety | Import changes, version bumps, lockfile drift, breaking APIs, package scripts, runtime assumptions | lockfile consistency, new transitive deps, Node/Bun/runtime compatibility, platform assumptions, license red flags |
| Lane 4: Docs, intent, and drift | PR claims vs implementation, docs mismatch, migration/changelog gaps, stale examples | obligation mapping, changed behavior not documented, docs promising behavior not implemented |
| Lane 5: Tests and falsifiability | Weak assertions, missing edge tests, flaky patterns, mock leakage, fixture drift | assertion strength, tautology patterns (`expect(true).toBe(true)`, `expect(res).toBeDefined()` without further checks), `assertDoesNotThrow` wrapping trivial code), negative paths, isolation, deterministic timing, cross-platform path coverage |
| Lane 6: Performance and architecture | Complexity regressions, memory leaks, over-coupling, inefficient graph scans, global mutable state | algorithmic deltas, caching, resource lifecycle, state ownership, architectural boundary violations |

### Explorer context contract

Every explorer must inspect or explicitly mark unavailable:

1. the changed hunk,
2. at least one caller, consumer, or downstream impact-cone node,
3. at least one callee, dependency, or upstream assumption,
4. at least one sibling implementation or prior pattern,
5. the nearest relevant test or missing-test location,
6. deterministic signal entries mapped to its files/symbols,
7. relevant Swarm knowledge/evidence entries, if present.
8. the commit range to analyze (`base_ref..head_ref`),

### Explorer output format

Explorers emit structured candidate records. The parser reads the full lane
artifact and extracts these records. The canonical record shape is:

```text
[CANDIDATE] | candidate_id | lane | severity | category | file:line | claim | evidence_summary | impact_context | confidence: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
```

The parser normalizes this into a structured `candidates[]` array. If the
parser is unavailable, the explorer MAY emit the `[CANDIDATE]` row format
directly in the lane output as a fallback convention.

Explorers must not use `CONFIRMED`, `DISPROVED`, or `PRE_EXISTING`.

---

## Phase 4: Triggered Swarm Plugin Micro-Lanes

After `collect_lane_results` returns for base lanes, inspect the context pack risk triggers. Launch focused micro-lanes for triggered categories only, using `dispatch_lanes_async` again when more than one read-only micro-lane is needed. Collect every micro-lane batch with `wait: true` before reviewer classification. Do not launch irrelevant micro-lanes.

Apply the same parser-based extraction to micro-lanes: call `parse_lane_candidates` on each micro-lane `output_ref` (filter the returned `candidates[]` array by `row_format_family === "micro_lane"` after parsing), and treat degraded or incomplete lane artifacts as UNVERIFIED coverage rather than as clean negative evidence.

Each micro-lane receives:

- exact files and hunks in scope,
- related obligations,
- impact cone entries,
- relevant deterministic signals,
- related historical knowledge with quarantine/staleness status,
- expected invariants,
- structured candidate output (parser-extracted). If the parser is unavailable,
  the micro-lane MAY emit `[CANDIDATE]` rows as a fallback convention.

### Swarm plugin risk trigger map

| Trigger in diff or context pack | Launch micro-lane | Invariants to check |
|---|---|---|
| `agents`, `prompts`, `templates`, prompt interpolation, role text | Architect prompt integrity | no scope escape, no system prompt leakage, safe `{{variable}}` interpolation, untrusted text isolated from instructions |
| `council`, `verdict`, `quorum`, `veto`, synthesis | Council orchestration | quorum math correct, veto enforced, evidence not lost, dissent preserved, no explorer result treated as final |
| `guardrail`, `gate`, `delegation`, `rate limit`, approval checks | Guardrail bypass paths | gates cannot be skipped, delegation cannot bypass policy, rate limits cannot be reset by user-controlled state |
| `schema`, `evidence`, JSONL, migrations, serializers | Evidence schema drift | backward compatibility, required fields preserved, version migration safe, malformed evidence rejected |
| `knowledge`, `curator`, `hive`, `quarantine`, memory | Knowledge base contract | project vs hive tiers not confused, quarantine honored, CRUD semantics stable, stale knowledge not injected as fact |
| `phase`, `state`, `plan`, `.swarm/state`, completion markers | Phase transition validation | ordering enforced, retro requirements handled, no premature completion, rollback safe |
| `model`, `role`, `prefix`, `tool`, agent config | Model-to-role mapping | role prefix enforced, tool permissions least-privilege, unauthorized tools impossible, model fallback safe |
| `config`, defaults, ratchet, locks, policy flags | Config ratchet semantics | once-enabled gates cannot silently disable, downgrade attempts detected, lock-state integrity preserved |
| `url`, `fetch`, `http`, GitHub PR/issue parsing, package fetch | URL sanitization and external fetch | scheme allowlist, credential stripping, private IP / localhost / metadata IP blocking, redirect handling, timeout safe |
| `git`, branch, checkout, reset, worktree, `.git` | Git safety | branch detection reliable, no unsafe `reset --hard`, .git protected, path normalization cross-platform, worktree state preserved |
| `shell`, `exec`, command parser, file writes, delete/move/copy | Shell/write authority and path containment | destructive commands gated, dry-run preferred, symlink/path escape blocked, writes scoped, command injection impossible |
| `test`, `bun`, mocks, fixtures, CI matrix | Test infrastructure | `bun:test` API correct, mock isolation, cross-platform paths, no hidden dependency on test order, fixtures reset |
| `metrics`, telemetry, logs, serialized traces | Metrics and evidence privacy | no secrets in logs, evidence reproducible, privacy preserved, counts cannot be gamed, metrics schema stable |

Micro-lane output format:

```text
[CANDIDATE] | candidate_id | micro_lane | severity | category | file:line | claim | invariant_violated | evidence_summary | confidence
```

---

## Phase 5: Swarm-Native Verifier Routing

Use Swarm-native agents and artifacts when available. If exact agent names are unavailable, route the same task to the closest equivalent reviewer/critic role.

| Swarm verifier / artifact | When to use | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `critic_drift_verifier` | obligation-vs-code, docs-vs-code, phase/gate changes, schema/config changes | detect drift between stated behavior and actual implementation |
| `critic_hallucination_verifier` | external APIs, package claims, URLs, CLI flags, GitHub behavior, model/tool names | verify claims against source or mark as unverified |
| `curator_phase` | before exploration and after synthesis | retrieve relevant lessons; write back confirmed true positives / false positives |
| `test_engineer` | confirmed/borderline correctness, security, state, schema, or config findings | propose or run falsification probes and regression tests |

## Phase 6: Independent Reviewer Confirmation

Route candidates to reviewer subagents. The orchestrator routes candidates
in bounded chunks produced by the parser-based extraction in Phase 3-4. Each
reviewer lane receives a bounded list of candidates from a single chunk — by
file area, category, or count — not the full candidate set. The reviewer must
re-read the candidate's file:line evidence and relevant context pack entries
directly.

### Noise budget and universal validation

Before reviewer dispatch, the orchestrator may suppress candidates that are ALL of:
- purely stylistic without correctness, security, test, maintainability, or user-impact implications,
- exact duplicates of a candidate already queued for validation,
- explorer-stated confidence=LOW with zero structural evidence (no file:line, no code path, no invariant reference).

Every suppressed candidate must appear in the final report under "Suppressed Candidates" with the reason. Suppression without disclosure is a hard rule violation.

**All remaining candidates — regardless of severity — must be routed to independent reviewer validation.** Severity alone does not determine validation eligibility; it determines routing priority. A LOW-severity candidate with file:line evidence and a specific code path gets the same reviewer attention as a HIGH-severity candidate.

Candidates not routed to reviewers must be listed as UNVERIFIED with reason in the validation provenance. Do not silently drop them.

### Reviewer required checks

For each candidate, the reviewer must determine:

- exact file:line evidence,
- whether the issue is introduced by this PR or pre-existing,
- reachability from realistic execution paths,
- whether caller guards, schema validation, middleware, framework defaults, feature flags, or state-machine constraints mitigate it,
- whether tests cover the negative path,
- whether sibling files or docs must change together,
- whether the severity is justified,
- the smallest falsification probe that would prove or disprove it.

### Reviewer classifications

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONFIRMED` | Evidence is real, reachable or structurally proven, and introduced or exposed by this PR |
| `DISPROVED` | Candidate claim is incorrect, unreachable, mitigated, or based on a misunderstanding |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Available evidence is insufficient to determine validity |
| `PRE_EXISTING` | Issue exists on the base branch and is not materially worsened by this PR |

### Evidence classifications

| Type | Definition |
|---|---|
| `STRUCTURALLY_PROVEN` | File:line evidence directly demonstrates the bug or violated invariant |
| `EXECUTION_PROVEN` | A test, trace, reproduction, or command demonstrates failure |
| `STATIC_TRACE_PROVEN` | Static analysis plus reviewed path/context demonstrates reachability |
| `PLAUSIBLE_BUT_UNVERIFIED` | Pattern suggests risk, but reachability or mitigation is unresolved |

Reviewer output format:

```text
[REVIEWED] | candidate_id | classification | evidence_type | final_severity | introduced_by_pr: YES/NO/UNKNOWN | file:line | rationale | falsification_probe | reviewer_id
```

`DISPROVED` findings must include the reason. `PRE_EXISTING` findings must include the base-branch evidence if available.

---

## Phase 7: Falsification Probe Requirement

Each confirmed nontrivial finding must include at least one falsification artifact:

- runnable failing command,
- proposed regression test,
- mutation that current tests fail to kill,
- static-analysis trace,
- minimal execution path,
- exact reason no runtime probe is available.

Nontrivial means any finding that affects correctness, security, state transitions, write authority, git safety, config, schema/evidence integrity, model/tool permissions, external fetches, persistence, or user-visible behavior.

A finding may still be reported without a runnable command if it is structurally proven, but the report must state why a runtime probe was not available.

---

## Phase 8: Critic Challenge

Route every reviewer-confirmed HIGH or CRITICAL finding to a critic. Also route borderline MEDIUM findings when they involve security, state machines, write authority, evidence integrity, model/tool permissions, git safety, or config ratchets.

The critic must challenge:

- severity inflation,
- weak or incomplete evidence,
- missing mitigating context,
- false reachability assumptions,
- framework or middleware defaults,
- schema validation gates,
- state-machine constraints,
- feature flags or dead code,
- pre-existing status,
- non-actionable or unsafe fix recommendations,
- sibling-file gaps,
- whether multiple comments should be grouped into one root cause.

Critic output format:

```text
[CRITIC] | finding_id | UPHELD/DOWNGRADED/DISPROVED/NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE | final_severity | reason | required_report_change
```

## Verdict row contract

The `[CRITIC]` row in the format above is **mandatory contract**, not advisory output. A critic response that does not end with that exact row format is treated as a planning preamble, not a verdict, and must be re-dispatched. Do not proceed past Phase 8 join barrier until each dispatched critic lane has produced a parseable `[CRITIC]` row.

**Re-dispatch trigger:** when a critic lane response is missing the verdict row, the orchestrator must automatically re-dispatch that lane with the explicit instruction: "Your final line MUST be exactly the Phase 8 contract row: `[CRITIC] | finding_id | UPHELD/DOWNGRADED/DISPROVED/NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE | final_severity | reason | required_report_change`. A response without that exact row will be treated as a planning message and re-dispatched." Do not synthesize findings from the planning preamble; only from the re-dispatched verdict.

Refuted findings become `DISPROVED` or `ADVISORY`, depending on critic rationale. Downgrades must be listed in the final validation provenance.

---

## Runtime-Aware False-Positive Guard Checklist

Before confirming any finding, the reviewer and critic must check all that apply:

- [ ] Schema validation gate: does schema validation reject malformed input before the flagged line?
- [ ] Middleware interception: does middleware handle the request or command before the flagged path?
- [ ] Framework default mitigation: does the framework inherently prevent this class of issue?
- [ ] Caller context correctness: who invokes this code, and can untrusted input reach it?
- [ ] Execution reachability: is the path reachable, or behind a feature flag, dead branch, build-only path, or commented-out code?
- [ ] State-machine constraints: do ordering rules, locks, mutexes, phase gates, or transition guards prevent the state?
- [ ] Permission boundary: does role/tool mapping prevent the operation?
- [ ] Data lifetime: is the flagged state persisted, serialized, logged, or only transient?
- [ ] Cross-platform behavior: does Windows/macOS/Linux path or shell behavior change the result?
- [ ] Test environment mismatch: is the finding only true under a mock or fixture that cannot occur in production?

If a mitigation applies and was not accounted for, downgrade to `ADVISORY`, `UNVERIFIED`, or `DISPROVED`.

---

## Phase 9: Synthesis, Grouping, and Noise Budget

Before final output:

- group duplicate candidates by root cause,
- report one finding per root cause,
- attach all affected file:line references under that finding,
- separate ship blockers from advisory notes,
- suppress pure style/nit findings unless they indicate correctness, security, test, maintainability, or user-impact risk,
- distinguish PR-introduced from pre-existing,
- distinguish confirmed from plausible-but-unverified,
- include disproved agent/tool claims,
- keep final comments actionable.

### Finding ID format

```text
F-001 | severity | category | root cause | affected file:line refs | reviewer | critic status
```

### Suggested final grouping

1. Ship blockers,
2. Important non-blockers,
3. Test / coverage gaps,
4. Pre-existing issues,
5. Unverified plausible risks,
6. Disproved candidates / false positives,
7. Clean lane summary.

---

## Phase 10: Metrics and Knowledge Writeback

At the end of the review, record review quality metrics when Swarm metrics or local evidence storage is available.

Record:

- raw candidates by base lane,
- raw candidates by micro-lane,
- deterministic tool candidates,
- reviewer-confirmed findings,
- reviewer-disproved findings,
- reviewer-unverified findings,
- critic-upheld findings,
- critic-downgraded findings,
- critic-disproved findings,
- final reported findings,
- suppressed non-actionable candidates,
- recurring false-positive patterns,
- commands or probes used,
- token/time cost if available,
- accepted/fixed findings when known.

Knowledge writeback rules:

- Write back only validated true positives or validated false-positive patterns.
- Include file patterns, invariant, evidence, and why it was confirmed/disproved.
- Mark repo-specific lessons as project-tier unless there is strong evidence they generalize.
- Never promote quarantined or unvalidated knowledge to hive-tier.
- Never store secrets, private tokens, or raw sensitive logs.

---

## Phase 11: Post-Fix Re-verification

When the PR author pushes fixes after a review, perform a targeted re-verification before updating the verdict.

### Re-verification scope

Only re-verify findings the author claims to have fixed. Do not re-run the full review pipeline.

### Re-verification steps

1. For each finding the author claims fixed:
   a. Read the changed file(s) from the updated branch at the specific lines referenced in the original finding.
   b. Verify the fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom.
   c. Check that the fix does not introduce a new issue in the same area.
2. Run CI checks on the updated branch to confirm no regressions.
3. For findings the author did not address, carry forward the original finding with unchanged status.

### Re-verification output

```
[REVERIFIED] | finding_id | FIXED / PARTIALLY_FIXED / NOT_FIXED / NEW_ISSUE | evidence | updated_severity
```

- `FIXED`: the root cause is resolved and no new issue introduced.
- `PARTIALLY_FIXED`: the root cause is partially addressed or a residual concern remains.
- `NOT_FIXED`: the root cause persists unchanged.
- `NEW_ISSUE`: the fix introduced a new problem at the same location.

Update the verdict only after re-verifying all previously blocking findings.

## Dry-Run: Parser-Based Candidate Extraction

This section demonstrates the new parser-based extraction path end-to-end
using synthetic data. It is concrete enough to implement the same pattern in
another skill.

### Scenario

A PR review has dispatched six base explorer lanes via `dispatch_lanes_async`.
The batch completed and `collect_lane_results` returned:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "batch-a1b2c3",
  "lane_results": [
    {
      "lane_id": "pr_review_lane1_correctness",
      "status": "completed",
      "output_ref": ".swarm/lane-results/batch-a1b2c3/lane-1/out-abc123.json",
      "output_degraded": false
    },
    {
      "lane_id": "pr_review_lane2_security",
      "status": "completed",
      "output_ref": ".swarm/lane-results/batch-a1b2c3/lane-2/out-def456.json",
      "output_degraded": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 1 — Call the parser

The orchestrator calls `parse_lane_candidates` for each `output_ref`:

```json
{
  "tool": "parse_lane_candidates",
  "arguments": {
    "output_ref": ".swarm/lane-results/batch-a1b2c3/lane-1/out-abc123.json",
    "producer": "swarm-pr-review"
  }
}
```

### Step 2 — Structured response

The parser returns a `ParseResultWithSidecar`. On success, `error` and `error_code` are absent:

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "record_type": "candidate",
      "row_format_family": "base_explorer",

    "candidate_count": 2,
    "parse_errors": 2,
    "parse_error_details": [
      {
        "row_index": 0,
        "field": "row",
        "message": "Both format-family discriminators present; defaulting to base_explorer"
      },
      {
        "row_index": 1,

    "degraded_source_count": 0,
    "incomplete_source_count": 0,
     "format_families_detected": ["base_explorer"]
   }
}
```
> **Note**: `parse_errors: 2` reflects FR-017/SC-017 position-based detection: when a `[CANDIDATE]` row has both `evidence_summary` and `impact_context` populated, the parser emits a `parse_error_details` entry per row with `field: "row"` and `message: "Both format-family discriminators present; defaulting to base_explorer"`. This is documented behavior, not a parser bug. To get `parse_errors: 0` with the row format, leave one of the two fields empty; to silence the warning entirely, emit structured JSON candidate records.

On refusal (e.g. `output_ref` does not exist), `error` and `error_code` are present; `candidates` is `[]`; `invocation_envelope` and `diagnostics` are populated with empty fields for traceability:

```json
{
  "error": "Artifact reference not found in store",
  "error_code": "ref-not-found",
  "candidates": [],
  "invocation_envelope": {
    "record_type": "invocation",
    "source_output_ref": ".swarm/lane-results/batch-a1b2c3/lane-1/missing.json",
    "source_batch_id": "",
    "source_lane_id": "",
    "source_agent": "",
    "source_digest": "",
    "row_format_version": 1,
    "record_version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
    "produced_at": "2025-06-22T14:30:00.000Z",
    "format_families_detected": [],
    "candidate_count": 0,
    "parse_errors": 0,
    "malformed_rows": 0
  },
  "diagnostics": {
    "candidate_count": 0,
    "parse_errors": 0,
    "parse_error_details": [],
    "malformed_rows": 0,
    "duplicate_id_count": 0,
    "duplicate_id_warnings": [],
    "degraded_source_count": 0,
    "incomplete_source_count": 0,
     "format_families_detected": []
   }
}
```

### Step 3 — Filter and group

The orchestrator filters the returned `candidates[]` array by `producer: "swarm-pr-review"` and `row_format_family` (e.g. `base_explorer` or `micro_lane`), then groups
the candidates. In this synthetic example, the two candidates above are grouped
by file area:

- **Chunk A — `src/utils/`** (1 candidate): C-001
- **Chunk B — `src/services/`** (1 candidate): C-002

If there were more candidates, the orchestrator would also group by category
(e.g., `null-safety`, `async-ordering`) and cap each chunk at 50 candidates.

### Step 4 — Dispatch reviewer lanes

The orchestrator dispatches one reviewer lane per chunk:

```text
You are the independent reviewer. Validate only the candidates assigned below.
Do not search for new issues except where needed to validate reachability or
mitigation. Do not trust explorer severity.

Context pack summary:
- scope: ...
- obligations: ...
- impact cone: ...
- deterministic signals: ...
- relevant Swarm artifacts / knowledge: ...
- base_ref: <commit SHA of base branch>
- head_ref: <commit SHA of PR head branch>

Candidates (Chunk A — src/utils/):
- C-001 | HIGH | null-safety | src/utils/cache.ts:142 | Uncached getter may return undefined on cold start

For each candidate, return:
[REVIEWED] | candidate_id | CONFIRMED/DISPROVED/UNVERIFIED/PRE_EXISTING | evidence_type | final_severity | introduced_by_pr | file:line | rationale | falsification_probe | reviewer_id

You must check caller context, reachability, schema/middleware/framework mitigations, state-machine constraints, test coverage, PR-introducedness, and severity.

IMPORTANT: If a finding claims behavior is "new" or "introduced by the PR", you MUST read the equivalent code on the base branch (git show <base_ref>:<file>) to verify it was not present before. A reviewer claim of "this is new" is invalid without base-branch evidence. Do not compare the new code to an idealized baseline — compare it to what actually existed on the base branch at the time of the PR.
```

### Key invariants

- The parser reads the **full artifact**, not a preview. Truncation in the
  `dispatch_lanes` preview does not affect candidate extraction.
- The orchestrator never classifies candidates — it only filters, groups, and
  routes them.
- Each reviewer receives a bounded chunk. A chunk with more than 50 candidates
  is split before dispatch.
- The `invocation_envelope` in the parser response provides audit provenance
  for every extracted candidate.

# Council Mode Workflow

Council mode is opt-in only and adversarial.

When triggered:

1. Build the same context pack as default mode.
2. Launch all council agents with one `dispatch_lanes_async` call when available; continue only non-dependent context preparation while they run, then use `collect_lane_results` with `wait: true` as the join barrier before reviewer classification. Fall back to blocking `dispatch_lanes` when async launch is unavailable.
3. Each council agent assumes all work is wrong until code evidence proves otherwise.
4. Each agent hunts within its lane only.
5. Agents return evidence states only: `EVIDENCE_FOUND`, `SUSPICIOUS`, or `CLEAN`.
6. Agents must not return `CONFIRMED`, `DISPROVED`, or final severity.
7. The independent reviewer then classifies every council candidate as `CONFIRMED`, `DISPROVED`, `UNVERIFIED`, or `PRE_EXISTING`.
8. Apply critic challenge to reviewer-confirmed HIGH/CRITICAL or borderline findings.
9. Final synthesis distinguishes real blockers, real low-severity issues, accepted caveats, disproved council claims, and follow-up quality work.

Default council lanes:

- correctness and edge cases,
- security and trust boundaries,
- dependency and deployment safety,
- docs and intent-vs-actual,
- tests and falsifiability,
- performance and architecture when risk justifies it.

Council prompt requirements:

- branch and commit range,
- context pack summary,
- files owned by that lane,
- relevant impact cone,
- explicit checklist,
- strict output cap,
- `EVIDENCE_FOUND / SUSPICIOUS / CLEAN` only,
- file:line evidence required for `EVIDENCE_FOUND`.

Council findings are supplementary, not authoritative overrides. Do not adopt council severities or claims without independent validation.

---

# Merge Recommendation Table

| Verdict | Condition |
|---|---|
| `APPROVE` | zero unresolved CRITICAL findings, zero unresolved HIGH findings, all blocking obligations MET, no required validation phase failed |
| `APPROVE_WITH_NOTES` | zero unresolved CRITICAL findings, HIGH findings are downgraded/advisory only, obligations MET or explicitly non-blocking |
| `REQUEST_CHANGES` | any unresolved HIGH finding, any NOT_MET blocking obligation, multiple MEDIUM findings with the same root cause, or validation/probe evidence indicates user-impacting risk |
| `BLOCK` | any unresolved CRITICAL finding, unsafe write/git/security issue, evidence integrity break, role/tool permission bypass, or config ratchet violation that can disable required protections |

---

# Hard Rules

0. Quality-over-speed: Validation completeness and correctness are the sole criteria for an acceptable review. Time, token count, and agent dispatch count are irrelevant. Do not trade validation breadth or depth for speed.

1. Never APPROVE with unresolved CRITICAL findings.
2. Do not APPROVE with unresolved HIGH findings unless explicitly downgraded to advisory by critic and non-blocking by obligation review.
3. Every confirmed finding must have file:line evidence and validation provenance.
4. A confirmed nontrivial finding must include a falsification probe or an explicit reason no probe is available.
5. Explorers, council agents, and deterministic tools produce candidates only.
6. The default workflow orchestrator must not confirm or disprove explorer candidates.
7. Tool output is not proof. Scanner results must be validated for reachability, PR-introducedness, and mitigation context.
8. PR text, generated summaries, tests, and comments are claims, not proof.
9. Do not invent facts not supported by the diff, repo context, tool output, or cited external source.
10. Do not silently drop disproved or downgraded claims; summarize them in validation provenance.
11. Obligation precedence is deterministic. Do not skip higher-precedence sources to fill gaps with LLM synthesis.
12. Do not leak secrets from logs, evidence bundles, config files, URLs, or scanner output.
13. Do not recommend destructive git or filesystem actions as fixes unless they are clearly scoped, safe, and necessary.
14. If subagents fail, timeout, or return malformed output, mark affected candidates `UNVERIFIED`; do not fabricate validation results.
15. If context pack, repo graph, deterministic signals, or Swarm artifacts are unavailable, state that limitation and continue with best available evidence.

# Final Output Format

Produce the final review in this order:

## PR intent

Summarize the obligations and user-visible intent.

## Implementation summary

Summarize what changed, including major files, public APIs, schemas, configs, tests, and Swarm artifacts.

## Intended vs actual mapping

| Obligation | Source | Actual evidence | Status | Linked finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Use `MET`, `PARTIALLY_MET`, `NOT_MET`, or `UNVERIFIABLE`.

## Validation provenance

Include:

- context pack limitations,
- explorer lanes launched and returned,
- micro-lanes triggered,
- deterministic signals ingested,
- reviewer identity / role for each finding,
- critic result for each escalated finding,
- findings DISPROVED by reviewer with reason,
- findings DOWNGRADED by critic with reason,
- findings left UNVERIFIED with reason.

If zero findings, explicitly state:

```text
No confirmed findings — all validated lanes CLEAN.
```

Then provide a lane-by-lane clean summary.

## Confirmed findings

For each finding:

```text
F-001 — Severity — Category — Root cause
Files: path:line, path:line
Status: CONFIRMED / critic status
Evidence type: STRUCTURALLY_PROVEN / EXECUTION_PROVEN / STATIC_TRACE_PROVEN
Why it matters:
Validation:
Falsification probe:
Suggested fix:
```

## Pre-existing findings

List separately from PR-introduced findings.

## Unverified but plausible risks

Only include if useful and clearly labeled as unverified.

## Test / coverage gaps

Focus on missing tests that would catch real risks, not generic coverage requests.

## Disproved candidates and false positives

List concise reasons for notable false positives from explorers, tools, council agents, or reviewers.

## Verdict

Use one of:

- `APPROVE`
- `APPROVE_WITH_NOTES`
- `REQUEST_CHANGES`
- `BLOCK`

## Merge recommendation

Explain the recommendation in one short paragraph and list required actions before merge if applicable.

## Feedback handoff

When the review produced actionable validated findings or operational blockers,
include:

- the handoff artifact path,
- the preserved finding IDs and provenance that `swarm-pr-feedback` must carry
  forward,
- and an explicit question asking whether to continue into
  `swarm-pr-feedback`.

Use this exact continuation prompt format:

```text
/swarm pr-feedback <PR_URL> continue from .swarm/pr-review/<run_id>/feedback-handoff.md
```

# Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching reviewer subagents:

```text
You are the independent reviewer. Validate only the candidates assigned below.
Do not search for new issues except where needed to validate reachability or mitigation.
Do not trust explorer severity.

Context pack summary:
- scope: ...
- obligations: ...
- impact cone: ...
- deterministic signals: ...
- relevant Swarm artifacts / knowledge: ...
- base_ref: <commit SHA of base branch>
- head_ref: <commit SHA of PR head branch>

Candidates:
- ...

For each candidate, return:
[REVIEWED] | candidate_id | CONFIRMED/DISPROVED/UNVERIFIED/PRE_EXISTING | evidence_type | final_severity | introduced_by_pr | file:line | rationale | falsification_probe | reviewer_id

You must check caller context, reachability, schema/middleware/framework mitigations, state-machine constraints, test coverage, PR-introducedness, and severity.

IMPORTANT: If a finding claims behavior is "new" or "introduced by the PR", you MUST read the equivalent code on the base branch (git show <base_ref>:<file>) to verify it was not present before. A reviewer claim of "this is new" is invalid without base-branch evidence. Do not compare the new code to an idealized baseline — compare it to what actually existed on the base branch at the time of the PR.
```

# Critic Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching critic subagents:

```text
You are the adversarial critic. Challenge only reviewer-confirmed findings assigned below.
Your goal is to reduce false positives, severity inflation, and non-actionable reports.

For each finding, challenge:
- whether evidence proves the claim,
- whether the path is reachable,
- whether mitigations apply,
- whether severity is inflated,
- whether it is PR-introduced,
- whether suggested fixes are safe/actionable,
- whether related files were missed,
- whether multiple findings should be grouped.

Return:
[CRITIC] | finding_id | UPHELD/DOWNGRADED/DISPROVED/NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE | final_severity | reason | required_report_change

REQUIRED FINAL LINE — your final line MUST be exactly the row above (no variations, no labeled fields, no placeholders):
[CRITIC] | finding_id | UPHELD/DOWNGRADED/DISPROVED/NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE | final_severity | reason | required_report_change

A response without this exact row is treated as a planning preamble and re-dispatched. Do not output only a planning or investigation message.
```

# Explorer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching base explorer or micro-lane agents:

```text
You are an explorer. Optimize for recall, not final judgment.
Return candidates only. Do not use CONFIRMED, DISPROVED, or PRE_EXISTING.

Lane:
Scope:
Obligations:
Changed files/hunks:
Impact cone:
Relevant deterministic signals:
Relevant Swarm artifacts / knowledge:
Checklist:

You must inspect or mark unavailable:
1. changed hunk,
2. caller/consumer,
3. callee/dependency,
4. sibling implementation or prior pattern,
5. nearest test or missing-test location,
6. deterministic signals,
7. Swarm artifacts/knowledge.

Return:
[CANDIDATE] | candidate_id | lane | severity | category | file:line | claim | evidence_summary | impact_context | confidence
```

The orchestrator extracts candidates from the full lane artifact via
`parse_lane_candidates` as the primary mechanism. The `[CANDIDATE]` row
format above is a fallback convention for environments where the parser is
unavailable. Explorers should still emit structured records regardless of
whether the parser is present.

Do not let speed degrade validation quality.
