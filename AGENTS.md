# AGENTS.md — Engineering contract for opencode-swarm

> **This file is the root engineering contract for opencode-swarm. It applies to every contributor — human, Claude Code, OpenCode agent, or other automated tool. Read it fully before making any code change. It is intentionally short and operational; the long-form rationale and historical failure map live in `docs/engineering-invariants.md`.**

## Required reading order

| When you are about to do… | Read these (in order) |
| --- | --- |
| Any code change | `AGENTS.md` (this file) → `docs/engineering-invariants.md` (skim, deep-dive on touched invariants) |
| Write or modify any test file | this file → `.opencode/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` (or `.claude/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` for Claude) |
| Commit / push / open a PR | this file → `.claude/skills/commit-pr/SKILL.md` |
| Swarm-mode Claude work | this file → `CLAUDE.md` → `.claude/session/swarm-mode.md` (when present) |
| Architecture / plugin init / subprocess / tool-registration / plan-durability / .swarm storage / runtime-portability change | this file → `docs/engineering-invariants.md` → `.opencode/skills/engineering-conventions/SKILL.md` (or `.claude/skills/engineering-conventions/SKILL.md`) |

`AGENTS.md` and `docs/engineering-invariants.md` together are the single source of truth for repository invariants. When `CLAUDE.md`, `contributing.md`, `TESTING.md`, or any skill conflicts with this file, **this file wins**; that skill or doc is out of date and must be reconciled.

## Prime directive

Preserve the runtime contracts that keep the plugin **loadable, portable, bounded, recoverable, and safe** across Windows, macOS, Linux, GUI, TUI, Bun, and Node-hosted plugin contexts.

A plugin that loads on macOS but hangs Desktop Windows is a regression. A change that passes locally on one platform but corrupts state on another is a regression. Default to "what could go wrong on the host I am not testing on?"

## Non-negotiable invariants

Every PR that touches a relevant area must list which of these invariants it touched and how it verified them. See "Invariant audit required in PRs" below.

### 1. Plugin initialization is fast, bounded, fail-open, side-effect-minimal

- Plugin registration must complete in bounded time on every supported platform. The OpenCode plugin host silently drops a plugin whose entry never resolves; users see "no agents in TUI/GUI" with no error.
- **No unbounded** filesystem scans, Git commands, network calls, package-manager calls, cache repair, repo-graph construction, or large JSON repair before returning the plugin manifest.
- Any init-path environmental work must be wrapped in `withTimeout(...)` (or equivalent), log non-fatally, and continue. Compare `loadSnapshot(...)` in `src/index.ts` (already wrapped) and `ensureSwarmGitExcluded(...)` (post-fix wrapped).
- Any init-path subprocess must use **explicit `cwd`**, **`stdin: 'ignore'`** (unless intentionally interactive), **`timeout`**, **bounded or ignored stdout/stderr**, and a **best-effort `proc.kill()` in `finally`**.
- GUI and TUI must still receive the plugin manifest even if optional startup work fails.
- Reference prior failures: v7.0.3 (`#704` repo-graph Desktop hang), v7.3.3 (`#732` Git-hygiene startup regression — the proximate cause of this AGENTS.md).

### 2. Runtime portability — Node-ESM-loadable + OpenCode v1 plugin shape

- The main plugin bundle (`dist/index.js`) must remain Node-ESM-loadable. **No top-level `bun:` imports** (see v6.86.8 / `bundle-portability.test.ts`).
- **No direct `Bun.*` calls** outside `src/utils/bun-compat.ts`. CLI-only modules that intentionally `--target bun` are the only exception.
- The default export must remain the v1 plugin object shape `{ id, server }` (see v6.86.9 / `bundle-plugin-shape.test.ts`).
- Any change touching `src/index.ts`, package exports, `package.json#main`, `bun build` config, `dist/`, or plugin entry shape must run the bundle-portability and plugin-shape tests AND `node --input-type=module -e "await import('./dist/index.js')"`.

### 3. Subprocesses — bounded, non-interactive, killable, portable

- **Array-form spawn only.** No shell-string commands unless the use case is independently justified and quoted.
- Set `cwd` explicitly. Do not rely on the inherited working directory.
- `stdin: 'ignore'` unless the spawn is intentionally interactive. A never-closed stdin pipe under Bun on Windows can block the child from exiting (see v7.3.3 fix).
- `timeout: <ms>` is required for git, package managers, test runners, language tooling, and any external binary. There is no platform on which "git is always fast" is a safe assumption.
- Consume, bound, or ignore stdout/stderr. Never leave a piped stream unattended on a long-running child.
- Best-effort `proc.kill()` in `finally`. An outer `withTimeout` alone is not enough — it lets the awaiter proceed but does not abort the child.
- Windows is first-class. Handle `.cmd` extensions for npm/bun binaries, PATH differences, and the fact that `child_process.spawn('bin', ...)` does not behave identically to `cmd.exe`.

### 4. Working directory and `.swarm/` containment

- Runtime state lives **only** under the project root `.swarm/` directory. Tools must use `ctx.directory` injected via `createSwarmTool` (`src/tools/create-tool.ts`).
- `process.cwd()` is an explicitly documented **direct-CLI / test fallback only**. Do not introduce new `process.cwd()` callers in tools or hooks.
- User-supplied `working_directory` must resolve to the project root, never a subdirectory. See v6.82.2 (`#577`): `save_plan` and the shared `resolveWorkingDirectory` helper anchor inputs.
- No tool may create `.swarm/` under `src/`, `tests/`, `packages/*`, or any arbitrary `cwd`. New-directory checks must be explicit.
- `.swarm/` must not become Git pollution. The `ensureSwarmGitExcluded` flow (v7.3.3) keeps the project's `.git/info/exclude` honest; do not bypass it.

### 5. Plan durability — ledger is authoritative

- `.swarm/plan-ledger.jsonl` is the authoritative source of plan state. `.swarm/plan.json` and `.swarm/plan.md` are derived projections.
- `SWARM_PLAN.{json,md}` files are checkpoint / export artifacts, scoped to `.swarm/` (v7.0.1 / `#583`).
- Do not hand-edit `plan.md` as a source of truth. Do not write to `plan.json` outside the ledger replay path.
- Any plan-schema or status-shape change must update **all six** of: ledger replay, projection, checkpoint import/export, `get_approved_plan`, tests, and docs (`docs/plan-durability.md`).

### 6. Test execution — do not use broad `test_runner` for repo validation

- Do not use the OpenCode `test_runner` tool with `scope: 'all'` or broad `'graph'` / `'impact'` scope for **whole-repo validation**. `scope: 'all'` requires `allow_full_suite: true` and is intended for opt-in CI mirrors, not interactive use.
- `MAX_SAFE_TEST_FILES = 50` (`src/tools/test-runner.ts:26`). Resolutions exceeding this return `outcome: 'scope_exceeded'` with a SKIP instruction; broad scopes can stall or kill OpenCode.
- For repo validation, prefer **shell commands** (the per-file isolation loops in `contributing.md` / `TESTING.md`).
- For targeted agent validation, use `test_runner` with explicit `files: [...]` or small targeted scopes.

### 7. Test writing — bun:test, mock isolation, DI over `mock.module`

- All tests use `bun:test` only. No Jest, Vitest, etc. Bun's vitest-compat layer has known isolation bugs.
- Load the writing-tests skill (`.opencode/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md`) before modifying tests.
- `mock.module(...)` leaks across test files in Bun's shared test-runner process. Spread the real module when mocking, or — preferred — use **dependency injection** via a small `_internals` seam (see `src/utils/gitignore-warning.ts:_internals` and `src/hooks/diff-scope.ts:_internals` introduced by the v7.3.4 fix). Restore the seam in `afterEach`.
- Use `os.tmpdir()` + `path.join(...)` for temp paths. No hardcoded `/tmp` or `C:\` strings.
- `mkdtempSync` must be wrapped in `realpathSync` if the result is `chdir`'d on macOS.

### 8. Session and global state — keyed and bounded

- Anything session-scoped must be keyed by `sessionID` (see v6.80.2 `recentToolCallsBySession` and `lastSpiralTimestampBySession` fixes).
- Module-level global state must have an explicit eviction strategy (`MAX_TRACKED_SESSIONS`, FIFO eviction).
- Add cooldowns for repeated safety/advisory behavior (e.g. spiral-detection 60 s cooldown).
- No cross-session pollution. Global arrays and maps that mix session data are bugs.

### 9. Guardrails / retry semantics

- Distinguish transient infrastructure / provider errors (HTTP 429 / 503 / 529, timeouts, "temporarily unavailable") from real agent-logic failures (see v6.86.14).
- Transient errors use bounded retry (`max_transient_retries`, default 5) **before** counting toward `consecutiveErrors` / circuit-breaker accounting.
- `transientRetryCount` resets per invocation. Do not persist it across invocations.
- Transient retry and model fallback are independent — neither subsumes the other.

### 10. Chat / system-message hook contracts

- Preserve OpenCode's expected message shape end-to-end. Multiple `output.system` entries are materialized into multiple `{ role: 'system' }` messages.
- After swarm augmentation, collapse to a single system message (see v6.85.1 / `#608`). Local models (Qwen3.6, Gemma) require exactly one system message at index 0.
- Do not emit diagnostic noise into chat-visible streams. Use the debug-gated logger (`src/utils/log.ts`) unless the message is an operational or security warning that must always be visible.

### 11. Tool registration + agent-map coherence

- A tool addition is **incomplete** until: (a) export from `src/tools/index.ts`, (b) registration in the plugin `tool: {}` block in `src/index.ts`, (c) entry in `TOOL_NAMES` and `AGENT_TOOL_MAP` in `src/config/constants.ts`, (d) help/documentation surfaces, (e) tests covering the new entry.
- Run `tests/unit/config/*.test.ts` and `/swarm doctor tools` after any tool, agent-map, command, or help change. See v6.48.0.
- Parity assertions across sibling map entries are intentional. If a parity test fails, mirror the change to siblings (most common) or update the invariant test if the design intent has actually changed.

### 12. Release / cache hygiene

- A plugin fix is incomplete if users stay pinned to a stale OpenCode plugin cache. Install / update / cache changes must cover **all known cache layouts**, including the macOS / Windows variants documented in v6.86.9 (Layout 1 `~/.cache/opencode/packages/opencode-swarm@latest`, Layout 2 `~/.config/opencode/node_modules/opencode-swarm`, Layout 3 `~/.cache/opencode/node_modules/opencode-swarm`).
- Cache-deletion code must use `isSafeCachePath` four-layer defense (depth, basename whitelist, recognized parent, canonical structure).
- **Never hand-edit** `package.json#version`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `.release-please-manifest.json`. release-please owns those.
- Every PR ships a `docs/releases/v{NEXT_VERSION}.md` file (mandatory — see `contributing.md`). It is the only narrative future users will see in their GitHub Release body.

## Invariant audit required in PRs

Every PR that touches a relevant area must include a `## Invariant audit` section in its description (see `.claude/skills/commit-pr/SKILL.md`). The required format is:

```
## Invariant audit
- 1 (plugin init):       touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 2 (runtime portability): touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 3 (subprocesses):       touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 4 (.swarm containment): touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 5 (plan durability):    touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 6 (test_runner safety): touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 7 (test writing):       touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 8 (session state):      touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 9 (guardrails/retry):   touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 10 (chat/system msg):   touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 11 (tool registration): touched / not touched — <evidence>
- 12 (release/cache):     touched / not touched — <evidence>
```

For every "touched" entry, the evidence must be a concrete artifact: a command run with its output, a test that proves the invariant, a grep showing no remaining anti-patterns, or a quoted spec citation. "Looks fine" is not evidence.

If you cannot prove a touched invariant from source and test output, **do not push**.

## When in doubt

- Ask, don't guess. The patterns in this file are the result of prior outages — every one has a release note in `docs/releases/`.
- Prefer the smallest patch that closes the issue without unwired functionality, untested branches, or hidden regressions.
- Defense in depth is cheap; an unbounded await is not.
