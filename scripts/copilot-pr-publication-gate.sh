# Best-effort preToolUse guardrail for AI coding agents. It blocks
# `gh pr create|edit|ready` until the commit-pr publication evidence exists,
# nudging the agent back to the single source of truth before it publishes.
#
# This is a GUARDRAIL, not the authoritative enforcement. The authoritative
# enforcement is the `pr-standards` CI check plus branch protection on `main`.
# Whether the GitHub Copilot cloud agent invokes repository hooks under
# `.github/hooks/` is not documented as a supported feature at the time of
# writing, so do not rely on this hook alone — it is the first line of defense.
#
# The publication contract is owned by .claude/skills/commit-pr/SKILL.md.
# The two evidence files checked below are produced by that skill's
# "Publication-gate evidence" step.
#
# Input: the hook payload is read from stdin (the tool invocation, including the
# command the agent is about to run).
