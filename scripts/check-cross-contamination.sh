# test file pairs together in the same Bun process. Bun's shared test runner can
# leak vi.mock('node:fs') and vi.mock('node:child_process') across files, causing
# false test failures that don't appear when tests run individually.
#
# KNOWN pre-existing leaks are tracked with an additional "known_expected" field.
# A regression occurs when the pass count drops below the known_expected value.
# This lets us track known issues without blocking CI, while catching new leaks.

# When the _internals DI seam migration fixes the leak, update this value to match
# the expected sum. When it reaches the sum, remove the entry entirely.
