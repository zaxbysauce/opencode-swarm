/**
 * SAST Baseline — phase-scoped snapshot of pre-existing security findings.
 *
 * Enables baseline diffing so only NEW findings (introduced since baseline capture)
 * drive the fail verdict in subsequent sast_scan calls.
 *
 * Storage: .swarm/evidence/{phase}/sast-baseline.json
 *   Mirrors the phase-scoped convention used by write-drift-evidence.ts and
 *   write-hallucination-evidence.ts (path.join('evidence', String(phase), filename)
 *   passed to validateSwarmPath).
 *
 * Fingerprint format (stable):
 *   `${relFile}|${rule_id}|${sha256(3lineWindow).slice(0,16)}|#${occurrenceIndex}`
 *
 * Fingerprint format (unstable — file unreadable or path escapes workspace):
 *   `${relFile}|${rule_id}|L${line}|UNSTABLE|#${occurrenceIndex}`
 *   Unstable fingerprints are ALWAYS treated as NEW findings (fail-closed).
 *
 * Merge semantics:
 *   On every capture for a set of files, ALL prior fingerprints for those files
 *   are removed (full prune, engine-agnostic) before inserting current findings.
 *   This prevents stale cross-engine fingerprints from causing false-pass verdicts.
