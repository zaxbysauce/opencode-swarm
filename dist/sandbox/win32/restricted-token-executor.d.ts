/**
 * Windows Restricted Token sandbox executor.
 *
 * Wraps shell commands with a PowerShell-based sandbox approach to restrict
 * process capabilities on Windows.
 *
 * Windows does not have a native sandbox mechanism equivalent to Linux bwrap
 * or macOS sandbox-exec that is accessible from Node.js without native bindings.
 * This executor provides best-effort sandboxing via:
 *   - Environment variable scrubbing (removing dangerous vars)
 *   - PATH restriction to safe system paths only
 *   - Scoped temp directory
 *   - PowerShell wrapper for command execution
 *
 * For true OS-level sandboxing (AppContainer, Restricted Token, Low Integrity),
 * native Windows APIs (CreateAppContainerToken, CreateRestrictedToken) are required.
