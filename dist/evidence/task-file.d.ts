 * Shared write primitives for the flat task-scoped evidence file

 * This file is the single source of truth for *where* the flat task evidence
 * file lives and *how* it is written safely. Multiple writers target the same
 * `{taskId}.json` (the delegation-gate hook via `gate-evidence.ts`, and the
 * Work-Complete council via `council-evidence-writer.ts`). They MUST coordinate
 * through the same lock key and use the same atomic temp-file+rename write, or
 * one writer's read-modify-write can clobber the other's (lost update) or
 * observe a torn file.
 *
 * The lock is keyed by the *relative* evidence path, so every writer has to
 * pass the identical relative path to `withEvidenceLock`. Centralizing that
 * derivation here (`taskEvidenceRelPath`) guarantees the keys match.
 *
 * This module deliberately holds no schema/validation logic — each caller keeps
 * its own taskId validation and read/merge semantics.
