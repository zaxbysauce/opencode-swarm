 * events computed from an in-memory plan the caller is about to persist,
 * it is always valid. For `task_status_changed` events, pass a

 * longer applies (e.g. the task's on-disk status already matches the
 * `to_status`, or has moved past it). When `verifyValid` returns false,
 * the retry loop exits and the helper returns `null` to signal that the
 * event was skipped — it is not an error.

 *   - maxRetries: max stale-writer retries (default: 3)
 *   - backoffMs: base delay in milliseconds (default: 10; exponential)
 *   - verifyValid: callback invoked before each retry to confirm the
 *     event input is still meaningful. Returning false aborts and
 *     resolves the helper to `null`.
 * @returns The written LedgerEvent, or `null` if verifyValid aborted.
