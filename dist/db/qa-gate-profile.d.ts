 * Active enforcement consumers (keep this list in sync when wiring new gates):
 * - reviewer / test_engineer — src/hooks/delegation-gate.ts (Stage B state
 *   machine; blocks coder→next-coder advancement until reviewer + test_engineer
 *   delegations observed).
 * - council_mode — src/state.ts isCouncilGateActive + src/hooks/delegation-gate.ts
 *   (Stage B replaced by convene_council verdict).
 * - sme_enabled — consumed during MODE: BRAINSTORM/SPECIFY architect dialogue.
 * - critic_pre_plan — consumed by MODE: PLAN critic delegation before save_plan.
 * - sast_enabled — consumed inside pre_check_batch tool.
 * - hallucination_guard — src/tools/phase-complete.ts Gate 3 (blocks phase_complete
 *   until .swarm/evidence/{phase}/hallucination-guard.json has APPROVED verdict).
 * - mutation_test — src/tools/phase-complete.ts Gate 4 (blocks phase_complete
 *   until .swarm/evidence/{phase}/mutation-gate.json has pass verdict; warn does not block)
 * - council_general_review — src/agents/architect.ts SPECIFY-COUNCIL-REVIEW
 *   (fires when gate is true; runs convene_general_council on draft spec before
 *   critic-gate to fold multi-model deliberation into the spec).
 *
 * Session overrides are intentionally ephemeral — they live only in
 * in-memory `AgentSessionState.qaGateSessionOverrides` and are NOT
 * persisted to the session snapshot. Process restart clears them.
