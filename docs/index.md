## Getting Started — Choose Your Path

**I am a new user** — I want to get Swarm running on my first project  
→ Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) — a 15-minute first-run walkthrough

**I am an operator** — I want to install Swarm in CI/container or a specific environment  
→ Choose your platform:
- [Installation Guide](installation.md) — comprehensive reference for all platforms
- [Installation: Linux + Docker](installation-linux-docker.md) — native Linux, Windows, Docker Desktop specifics
- [Installation: LLM Operator](installation-llm-operator.md) — machine-executable runbook for LLM-driven setup

**I am a contributor** — I want to understand the architecture or contribute to the project  
→ Read [Architecture Deep Dive](architecture.md) and [Design Rationale](design-rationale.md), then [CONTRIBUTING.md](../contributing.md)
