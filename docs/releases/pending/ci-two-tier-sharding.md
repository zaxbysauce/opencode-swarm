# CI: Two-tier CI with automatic test sharding

## What changed

The CI pipeline (`ci.yml`) was restructured to reduce PR feedback time from ~40 minutes to ~12 minutes and to prepare for merge queue adoption.

**Two-tier CI:** Merge-queue-only jobs (`integration`, `smoke`, `php-validation`, `rust-sandbox-runner`) now gate all their steps with `if: github.event_name == 'merge_group'`. On `pull_request`, those jobs run but all steps are skipped, so the job completes in ~10 seconds while still satisfying required status checks. On `merge_group`, the full validation runs. Jobs that were always fast (`quality`, `package-check`, `security`) continue running on both events unchanged.

**Automatic round-robin test sharding:** The 20 hand-maintained test steps (which ran 118 files twice and silently skipped ~154 files) have been replaced with automatic file discovery via `find tests/unit -name '*.test.ts' -type f | sort` distributed across 4 parallel shards using modulo assignment. All 1049 test files are covered with zero duplication.

**Dynamic OS matrix:** Unit tests run on ubuntu-only for PRs and the full 3-OS matrix for merge queue runs.

## Why

1. **Cascading CI restarts:** When one PR merges, branch updates cascade to all open PRs, each restarting a 40+ min CI run. Enabling the merge queue (see below) stops the cascades entirely.
2. **CI duration:** The critical path through quality → unit (3-OS matrix, 140+ sequential files) → integration → smoke was 40+ minutes. Sharding and the two-tier split bring PR feedback to ~12 minutes.

## Migration steps (admin required)

The `unit` job matrix gains a `shard` dimension, changing required check names:

- **Old:** `unit (ubuntu-latest)`, `unit (macos-latest)`, `unit (windows-latest)`
- **New:** `unit (ubuntu-latest, 1)` through `unit (ubuntu-latest, 4)` (PR tier); `unit (ubuntu-latest, 1)` through `unit (windows-latest, 4)` (merge queue tier)

**Branch protection migration:**
1. Temporarily remove old `unit (...)` required checks
2. Merge this PR
3. Add new required checks: `unit (ubuntu-latest, 1)` through `unit (ubuntu-latest, 4)`, plus `quality`, `package-check`, `security`
4. The merge-queue-only jobs keep their existing names

**To eliminate cascading CI restarts (Problem #1), also:**
- Enable the GitHub merge queue on `main` in branch protection settings
- Disable "Require branches to be up to date before merging" (the merge queue handles freshness validation)

## Known caveats

- PR runs no longer run integration, smoke, php-validation, or rust-sandbox-runner. Cross-platform and integration bugs are caught at merge queue time instead of during development.
- macOS and Windows unit test failures are only surfaced in the merge queue, not on individual PRs.
