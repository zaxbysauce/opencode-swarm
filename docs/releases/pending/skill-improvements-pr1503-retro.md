# Skill improvements from PR #1503 retrospective

## What changed

Four documentation-only updates to agent skills, derived from operational findings during the PR #1503 review-and-fix run:

### `swarm-pr-review` skill

Strengthened the critic dispatch protocol. The `[CRITIC]` verdict row is now a **mandatory contract** enforced by a new "Verdict row contract" subsection in Phase 8, and the Critic Prompt Template appends a "REQUIRED FINAL LINE" block that requires dispatched critics to end with the exact contract row. A critic response missing the row is treated as a planning preamble, not a verdict, and must be re-dispatched with the explicit requirement.

**Why:** During the PR #1503 review, both critic lanes returned only planning preambles ("I'll investigate the finding independently before rendering a verdict.") without verdict rows, wasting a dispatch round. The skill now provides an explicit re-dispatch trigger that the orchestrator can apply automatically.

### `swarm-pr-feedback` skill

Added a new "Pre-flight: Scope Discipline" section documenting the `declare_scope` vs direct Task delegation boundary. `declare_scope` requires an active `.swarm/plan.json`, which `swarm-pr-feedback` does not create; the carve-out for direct Task delegation is now narrowly limited to 1-file, single-function changes with explicit paths in the prompt. Multi-file feedback fixes must `save_plan` first.

### `commit-pr` skill

Two related updates:

- **Tier 1 - quality:** the biome command is now pinned to the `package.json` version (`bunx @biomejs/biome@<version> ci .` instead of `bunx biome ci .`). Unversioned `bunx biome` resolves to a different version than the CI gate uses, and a CI-blocking failure can be invisible to local pre-commit validation.
- **Commit messages subsection:** added a PowerShell-safe `git commit -F <file>` pattern for commit messages containing special characters (parens, brackets, backticks, dollar-signs). The pattern mirrors the existing PowerShell-safe patterns for PR bodies and issue comments.

### `engineering-conventions` skill

Added a new "Tool version parity (local vs CI)" section cross-referencing the `commit-pr` change. The section explains why tool versions must match between local validation and CI, and prescribes the canonical pinning pattern. Includes the PR #1503 biome 2.3.14 vs 0.3.3 mismatch as the motivating concrete example.

## Why

These changes codify operational lessons from a single end-to-end review run (PR #1503 / telemetry.jsonl rotation fix #1273) so the same class of issue does not reappear in future runs:

1. **Critic dispatch brittleness** — the critic join barrier could stall indefinitely if critics returned planning preambles without verdicts.
2. **Scope discipline gap** — the feedback workflow could not use `declare_scope` because it lacks a plan context, and the previous fallback (unscoped direct delegation) was too permissive.
3. **Tool version drift** — local biome (0.3.3) and CI biome (2.3.14) silently diverged, causing a CI failure that local validation could not catch.
4. **PowerShell commit escape** — `git commit -m` with special characters fails on PowerShell because the shell parses parens/brackets/backticks as expressions.

## Impact

- Skills now self-document the failure modes they previously relied on human detection to catch.
- No runtime code changes; all four edits are markdown-only.
- No new public API surface, no behavior changes, no migration required.

## Migration

No migration required. These are documentation-only changes to agent skills.
