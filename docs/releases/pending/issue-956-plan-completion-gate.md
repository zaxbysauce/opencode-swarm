# Plan Completion Gate

## Overview

Adds a completion gate to the delegation gate hook that blocks starting a new task when a previous task has completed QA gates (reached `tests_run` state) but hasn't been marked completed in `plan.json` via `update_task_status`. This prevents the architect from accidentally skipping the task completion checklist and moving to a new task before the current task's status is durably persisted.

## Bug Fixes

- **Restored `delegation-gate.ts` from `origin/main`**: PR #961 had removed `toolAfter` entirely (causing a runtime `ReferenceError` on load), deleted the coder re-delegation guard (`REVIEWER_GATE_VIOLATION`), removed Stage B parallel state advancement, removed council verdict state handling, and removed evidence recording. All were restored by using main as the base.

- **Added completion gate in `toolBefore`**: Runs before the Task-only guard so it covers ALL tools — `declare_scope`, `update_task_status`, and `Task`. When any task is in `tests_run` state but not marked completed in the plan, subsequent tool calls are blocked unless they're a same-task retry or an `update_task_status` completion for ANY awaiting task (including the requested one).

- **Fixed multi-task completion deadlock**: The completion gate now checks if the requested task is itself in `tests_run` state (via session workflow state lookup) rather than requiring an exact match with the task returned by `findTaskAwaitingCompletion`. Without this fix, parallel execution with multiple tasks in `tests_run` would deadlock because `findTaskAwaitingCompletion` skips the requested task and returns a different one.

- **Added completion state advancement in `toolAfter`**: Detects `update_task_status` calls with `status="completed"` and advances the session's task workflow state from `tests_run` to `complete`.

- **Added model-only `[NEXT]` guidance via `messagesTransform`**: Surfaces an advisory message directing the architect to call `update_task_status` before starting a new task, ensuring the completion state is durably persisted before any `declare_scope` or `Task` calls for a different task.

## New Functions

- `getPlanTaskStatus(plan, taskId)` — looks up task status from plan
- `resolveDelegatedPlanTaskId(args, knownPlanTaskIds?)` — extracts task ID from tool arguments with plan-aware filtering to exclude version numbers
- `findTaskAwaitingCompletion(directory, session, requestedTaskId?)` — finds tasks in `tests_run` state that aren't completed in `plan.json`
- `completionGateViolationMessage(taskAwaitingCompletion)` — generates violation error message

## Security

- `resolveDelegatedPlanTaskId` uses fail-closed design: explicit invalid `task_id` returns null (no text fallback), multiple distinct task IDs in text fields returns null (ambiguous), and plan-aware filtering excludes version numbers and other non-task numeric-dot patterns.
- Completion gate fires before the Task-only guard, ensuring `declare_scope` and `update_task_status` are also covered.

## Tests

104 tests across three files:
- `tests/unit/hooks/delegation-gate-completion-gate.test.ts`: 50 tests covering all helper functions, toolBefore/toolAfter hooks, messagesTransform, integration flows, edge cases, multi-task parallel completion, and 3 regression groups (toolAfter callable, coder re-delegation guard, council verdicts)
- `tests/unit/hooks/delegation-gate-plan-aware-filtering.test.ts`: 14 tests covering version number filtering, multi-ID ambiguity detection, and plan-aware same-task retry
- `tests/unit/hooks/delegation-gate-task-1-5.test.ts`: 40 tests covering batch detection, message preservation, parallel execution profile guidance, [NEXT] guidance injection, and sessionID validation

## Breaking Changes

None. The completion gate is additive — it only blocks operations that would have resulted in an inconsistent plan state where a task's session state shows it completed QA but the plan still shows it as in-progress.
