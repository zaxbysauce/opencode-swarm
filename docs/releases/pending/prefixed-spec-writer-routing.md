# Prefixed spec writer routing

## What changed

- Multi-swarm architect prompts now name the generated `*_spec_writer` and
  `*_skill_improver` agents instead of bare unprefixed names.
- Config doctor now warns when a per-swarm override uses a generated prefixed
  key such as `swarms.modelrelay.agents.modelrelay_spec_writer`; the canonical
  key is `swarms.modelrelay.agents.spec_writer`.

## Why

In named swarms, the generated spec writer is registered as
`<swarm>_spec_writer`, but the architect prompt still pointed at bare
`spec_writer`. A user could also configure the prefixed generated key, which
looked natural but was ignored and caused the agent to fall back to its default
model.

## Migration

Use canonical per-swarm override keys:

```json
{
  "swarms": {
    "modelrelay": {
      "agents": {
        "spec_writer": { "model": "provider/custom-spec" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Breaking changes

None for default configurations. Configurations that explicitly disable
`spec_writer` now stop SPECIFY/BRAINSTORM spec creation and ask the user to
re-enable `spec_writer` before creating or revising `.swarm/spec.md`, rather
than trying to draft the spec inline.

## Known caveats

Config doctor reports the prefixed override but does not auto-fix it, because
both the prefixed and canonical keys may be present and user intent can be
ambiguous.
