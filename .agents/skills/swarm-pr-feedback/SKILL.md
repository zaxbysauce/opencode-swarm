  Codex adapter for closing known PR feedback in opencode-swarm. Use when asked
  to address pasted review feedback, GitHub review comments or threads,
  requested changes, CI/check failures, merge conflicts, stale PR branches, or
  follow-up work that must verify and close all known PR issues.

# Swarm PR Feedback

Read and follow `../../../.opencode/skills/swarm-pr-feedback/SKILL.md` as the
canonical workflow.

## Codex Execution Notes

- Check out the PR branch locally before verifying or fixing anything. Fetch the
  head ref if absent, confirm the working tree is clean, then verify against the
  PR branch rather than the base branch.
- Build the complete feedback ledger before editing: pasted feedback, GitHub
  comments/threads, requested changes, CI/check failures, merge conflicts,
  stale branch state, PR body claims, linked issues, commits, and any validated
  `swarm-pr-review` handoff artifact.
- Treat every feedback item as a claim until source evidence, tests, logs, or
  PR metadata prove or disprove it.
- Preserve original finding IDs and reviewer/critic provenance from review
  handoff artifacts.
- For async verification lanes, treat `output` as a preview and call
  `retrieve_lane_output` for full `output_ref` artifacts before classifying or
  resolving feedback; degraded or incomplete lane outputs keep the affected
  items open as evidence gaps.
- Do not resolve GitHub review threads unless the user explicitly instructs it.
- Load `$writing-tests` before changing tests and `$commit-pr` before pushing or
  updating the PR.

Final responses must include a closure ledger for every original feedback item,
including conflicts, stale branch state, obsolete CI, and generated-output drift
when they affected the PR.
