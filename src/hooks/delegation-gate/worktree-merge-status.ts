/**
 * Worktree merge-back status registry (leaf module — no app imports).
 *
 * Bridges two subsystems that otherwise cannot see each other:
 *
 *   - WORKTREE ISOLATION (`worktree-isolation.ts`) knows, at merge-back
 *     time, whether a Task-dispatched coder's isolated worktree merged
 *     cleanly back into the main tree.
 *   - EPIC MODE Rule 2 (`plan/manager.updateTaskStatus`) auto-commits a
 *     `swarm(task <id>):` marker on completion. That marker is the
 *     evidence Rule 3 scans to decide a downstream task's upstream is
 *     satisfied.
 *
 * Without this bridge, a coder whose worktree merge-back FAILED (conflict)
 * leaves its changes stranded in the preserved worktree, yet Rule 2 would
 * still fire an `--allow-empty` marker and Rule 3 would treat the task as
 * done — silently advancing the plan past work that never landed.
 *
 * This module is deliberately a LEAF: it imports nothing from the app so
 * that both `worktree-isolation.ts` (writer) and `plan/manager.ts` (reader)
 * can depend on it without creating an import cycle.
 *
 * STATE DURABILITY: Status is stored in an in-memory Map (fast, per-process)
 * AND persisted to `.swarm/worktree-merge-status.json` (survives plugin restart).
 * On each write, the JSON file is atomically updated. On read, the in-memory
 * map is checked first (fast path); on plugin restart, the map is empty but
 * the durable file is restored on first read or Rule 2 lookup.
