/**
 * Epic Mode run-phase tool (Capability C).
 *
 * The architect invokes this tool — instead of `lean_turbo_run_phase` —
 * when Epic Mode is active. It:
 *
 *   1. Verifies Epic Mode is on for the session (else fails closed).
 *   2. Loads the plan, resolves task scopes the same way the coupling
 *      report does, and queries the co-change signal.
 *   3. Runs `decideEpicActivation` over the WHOLE PLAN (per-plan
 *      activation per Q1) to get a `promote | demote` verdict.
 *   4. Appends one record to `.swarm/evidence/epic-promotions.jsonl`
 *      and updates `.swarm/epic-state.json` with the verdict.
 *   5. If promoted: invokes `LeanTurboRunner` for the given phase by
 *      composition (zero edits to `src/turbo/lean/`).
 *   6. If demoted: returns a structured "epic recommends serial"
 *      verdict so the caller can fall back to the standard serial
 *      flow.
 *
 * Composition contract: this tool is the only architect-facing entry
 * point Capability C adds. It does not modify `lean_turbo_run_phase`,
 * `LeanTurboRunner`, or any Lean Turbo file. Decision happens above
 * Lean Turbo; execution dispatches into Lean Turbo via import only.

 * because it gives the user real-time visibility into each concurrent coder
 * agent. The legacy unified-path function `executeEpicRunPhase` remains

 *  1. Call this after declaring scopes for all pending tasks.
 *  2. Surface the verdict to the user.
 *  3. If verdict is `promote`, call `epic_plan_waves` to get the wave plan,
 *     then for each wave dispatch one `Task` per `taskId` in that wave —
 *     ALL in one assistant message so the wave runs concurrently. Wait for
 *     the wave to complete, then advance. Each Task is a visible subagent
 *     the user can click into for live progress.
 *  4. After each task completes (via `update_task_status`), call
 *     `epic_record_divergence` to feed the calibration loop.
 *
 * This is the CLI-visibility flow. The legacy `epic_run_phase` bundles
 * decide + dispatch into one opaque tool call where the user can't see
 * the concurrent coder agents.
